# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** — a simple and playful Python program that lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! 😎

---

## Features

- Accepts two numbers as input (supports decimals! ✨)
- Performs basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗
- Displays the results in a friendly, easy-to-read format

---

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. When prompted, enter the first number (decimals allowed).
3. Enter the second number.
4. See the magic happen with all four operations displayed!

---

## Example Usage

```
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25
```

## Notes

- The program assumes you will not divide by zero. Be careful to enter a non-zero second number to avoid errors.
- Inputs are converted to floats, so decimals are fully supported!

---

## How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

- The program asks for two inputs using `input()` and converts them to `float` for decimal support.
- It then calculates:
  - Sum (`+`)
  - Difference (`-`)
  - Product (`*`)
  - Quotient (`/`)
- Finally, it prints the results with fun emoji flair! 🎉
